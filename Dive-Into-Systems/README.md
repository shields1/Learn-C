Here's a 10-week study schedule for Dive Into Systems, assuming you dedicate 6–8 hours per week to studying. This plan balances reading, exercises, and coding practice.


---

Week 1: Introduction & C Programming Review

Read Chapters 1 & 2 (Introduction & C Programming Basics).

Review C programming concepts (pointers, memory management, structs).

Complete all exercises from these chapters.

Write small C programs to practice memory allocation and pointer arithmetic.



---

Week 2: Computer Organization & Data Representation

Read Chapter 3 (Computer Organization).

Study binary, hexadecimal, two’s complement, and floating-point representation.

Complete exercises on converting between number systems.

Write C functions that manipulate bitwise operations.



---

Week 3: Assembly Language & Machine Code

Read Chapter 4 (Assembly & Machine Code).

Learn x86-64 assembly basics.

Translate simple C programs into assembly using GCC (gcc -S).

Complete practice exercises on registers, instructions, and function calls.



---

Week 4: Memory Hierarchy & Caches

Read Chapter 5 (Memory Organization).

Study cache hierarchies, locality principles, and memory access patterns.

Complete exercises on cache performance calculations.

Write programs that measure cache performance (e.g., using large array accesses).



---

Week 5: The Stack, Heap & Dynamic Memory

Read Chapter 6 (Memory Management).

Study how the stack and heap work in memory.

Implement custom memory allocation functions in C.

Debug memory errors using Valgrind.



---

Week 6: Linking & Executables

Read Chapter 7 (Linking).

Understand static vs. dynamic linking, ELF format, and symbol resolution.

Experiment with nm and ldd commands in Linux.

Write a small program using static and dynamic libraries.



---

Week 7: Operating System Fundamentals

Read Chapter 8 (Operating Systems Basics).

Study processes, threads, and system calls.

Write programs that use fork(), exec(), and wait().

Explore file I/O operations in C.



---

Week 8: Virtual Memory & Page Tables

Read Chapter 9 (Virtual Memory).

Study page tables, TLBs, and memory translation.

Analyze memory allocation strategies (e.g., paging vs. segmentation).

Complete exercises on address translation.



---

Week 9: Parallelism & Multithreading

Read Chapter 10 (Parallel Computing).

Learn pthreads and OpenMP basics.

Write multithreaded C programs with pthreads.

Experiment with synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores, barriers).



---

Week 10: Advanced Topics & Final Review

Review key concepts from all chapters.

Read additional sections of interest (e.g., performance tuning).

Complete any unfinished exercises.

Work on a mini-project, such as:

A memory allocator

A cache simulation

A multithreaded application
