## Operating Systems & Low-Level Programming
**1. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces – Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau & Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau**
A fantastic, free book that covers memory management, scheduling, file systems, and concurrency in a clear and engaging way.
Great next step after Dive Into Systems.

**2. Modern Operating Systems – Andrew S. Tanenbaum**
A more detailed and academic approach to OS concepts like processes, scheduling, and security.

## Computer Architecture & Hardware
**1. Computer Organization and Design – David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy**
A hands-on introduction to computer architecture using MIPS assembly.
If you liked the low-level parts of Dive Into Systems, this is the next step.


**2. The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) – Noam Nisan & Shimon Schocken**
Walks you through building a computer from scratch, from logic gates to a full-fledged OS.
Comes with online projects—super interactive!


## Systems Programming & Performance Optimization

**1. Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective – Randal E. Bryant & David R. O’Hallaron**
Known as CS:APP, this book is gold for systems programmers. Covers assembly, memory, caching, and performance optimization.
Perfect if you want to understand how C, compilers, and OS interact at a deep level.


**2. High Performance Browser Networking – Ilya Grigorik (Free online)**
A must-read for those interested in networking, TCP/IP, and performance optimization.

## Compilers & Programming Language Internals
**1.Crafting Interpreters – Robert Nystrom**
If you want to write your own programming language, this is the best book out there.
Very hands-on, builds an interpreter step by step.
Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools – Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman ("Dragon Book")
The classic book on compilers, but dense. Only recommended if you're serious about compiler design.

## Security & Hacking (Bonus)

**1. Hacking: The Art of Exploitation – Jon Erickson**
Teaches you hacking by understanding low-level memory, buffer overflows, and assembly programming.

A good hands-on book if security interests you.
